# GugusseCompact
This project is intended as an upgrade for the Gugusse Roller ( www.deniscarl.com )

The objectives are:
    to make the machine more compact
    to make the film path more precise
    to make it easier to print

What will be reused from the Gugusse Roller project?
    - software
    - electronic board
    - the 2 turntables

I will try to use openscad as much as possible.
